# SystemDesign-project
## Project Overview:
I chosed VOX cinemas app where i will add an additional feature that are not available such as reviewing movie, online customer support...etc. The methodology we have used for the system development is agile methodology. Because it focuses on development and testing activities simultaneously with leading to communication with clients and developers.

## Problem Statement:
The features that are listed:
* Review: the review feature will have both Rate “Star button” & Comments under each movie. So the user can know other users opinion about a specific movie.

* Notifications when early movie booking open: it’s important to know when your favorite movie will open the booking.

* Online customer support “live chat”: live chat with the support members so when the user have a technical problem it can contact with them faster.

* Top 10 “the most watched movies this week”: This feature will show the top 10 movies based on the number of times people booked it.

* Cancel ticket button: Vox Cinema App has this feature but not directly in the app itself. Having cancel button under your ticket barcode is important.

* Rent Cinema Hall: it will allow the user to rent the cinema hall with their prices and schedule time.
